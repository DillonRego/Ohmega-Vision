# Jetson Code Repository

## Current Usable Files
- `main.cpp` and `run.sh`. These files run the cpp code developed last year. This code works but is not very powerful or efficient. 
- `lidar.py` rudimentary python LiDAR controller


## Python Instructions 
- librealsense2 library is required via instructions here https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/6964 and https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/python#installation
- Note: path exports are required (these have been done on the jetson)
- Python3.8 and python3.8-dev were used in development
